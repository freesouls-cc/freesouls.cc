    The free(d) souls is simply exquisite! So incredibly simple but with such
    incredible emotional resonance, especially given the way in which Joi's
    photos capture the brief unshuttered candor of a moment. A masterpiece in
    both form and concept. Joi at his best!

    Freesouls is a true source of inspiration. One can learn from, use, apply
    and re-imagine these images just as freely as you have been able to learn
    from, use, apply and re-imagine the thoughts that have made these particular
    souls noteworthy.

    Freesouls is an entry into a lively mind, the chance to travel and talk with
    people who banter about the future from far corners of the earth. Joi Ito
    shares his access to these provocative change-agents with a spirit of open
    information and dialog. The folks portrayed have worked to make good from
    their passions; Joi knits them together into his own curriculum on
    contemporary ethical freedom. A Freesoul is a living facet of Joi's
    contagious enthusiasm.
