    Love is the main source of power to survive the darkness and hard times. Having
    Noura in my soul and mind gave me hope when everything in my life
    collapsed in front of my eyes.

    I had decided to end my life in Cell No. 26 after eight months of no light and
    no hope. Then... I thought of Noura's eyes and got the feeling that I would see
    them again. That moment saved my life....

    After a month I was transferred to a new prison then after a couple more
    months I saw her eyes.

    I keep dreaming of the moment I can see the sky with no walls or bars.

    I was born in war-torn Beirut in 1982, my parents named me Céline, they
    chose a French name in the midst of the war and chaos as a symbol of
    hope. They thought it would be easier for me to have a name as far away from
    our complicated "Arab" identity as possible. That name gave them all
    something to look forward to. We escaped Lebanon in 1986, and were granted
    refugee status in Montréal, Canada. I saw my parents re-invent themselves
    countless times, my father by imagining what his dream career would be like
    given the present circumstance, and my mother pushing the limits of what she
    was thought she could be. Breaking the boundaries is something I grew up to
    think is a healthy coping mechanism. If you don't fit, make your own space,
    if no one wants to hire you, be your own boss, and so on. Fearless
    demonstration of unapologetic existence. I am here, even if this is the 25th
    place I call home. I am here, and I am going to do all that I can to exist,
    work, dream and create. Resilience is being open to constantly evolve and
    recreate one's sense of identity by looking forward, in hope, not looking
    back, in despair.

    I have not passed through the eye of any needle not of my own making. But, I
    may have survived some serious threats, blissfully unaware, and I may overly
    ascribe authorship of self-created threats to myself. Further, the preceding
    accounts for my individual survival, while the most probable threats to me
    are threats to many or all. So far, many including me have lucked out of
    such mass threats, despite failing to coordinate to secure global peace and
    justice. This non-story about non-knowledge, non-control, non-coordination,
    and luck gives me some small measure of understanding for those who have
    faced individual or mass threats, whether they survived or not, and whether
    the threats seem to be self-made or not. I'm thinking equally of our friend
    Bassel Khartabil, imprisoned for 5 years and very possibly murdered by the
    regime that currently controls major Syrian cities, who had full agency in
    choosing to return to Syria, and the millions in the region who had and have
    few to no options to escape the whirlwind created by wanton bigotry and
    avarice on all sides, and everyone, whether an apparent agent-victim or
    only-victim, throughout history. My non-story is not yet over, but it will
    be soon enough. We are all temporary survivors. I'll try to not crush you on
    the way to exit, and I hope that you'll do the same for me. But we've got to
    coordinate, or many will be crushed prematurely, and either of us could be
    one of them.
