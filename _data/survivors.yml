    Love is the main source of power to survive the darkness and hard times. Having
    Noura in my soul and mind gave me hope when everything in my life
    collapsed in front of my eyes.

    I had decided to end my life in Cell No. 26 after eight months of no light and
    no hope. Then... I thought of Noura's eyes and got the feeling that I would see
    them again. That moment saved my life....

    After a month I was transferred to a new prison then after a couple more
    months I saw her eyes.

    I keep dreaming of the moment I can see the sky with no walls or bars.
