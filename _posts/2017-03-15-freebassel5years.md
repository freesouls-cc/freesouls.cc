*Five years ago the FREESOULS community lost a colleague, a teacher, a
friend.*

Right up to that fateful day, Bassel Khartabil was a free man; a free
soul. He had dedicated his personal and professional life to open source
and open minds. Bassel had founded a hackerspace in Damascus, and later
became the project lead for Creative Commons Syria. He was a global
participant in the free culture movement. The last time that many of us
saw Bassel was at the Creative Commons Global Summit in Warsaw in 2011,
where he was continuing his work of expanding information and
opportunity in his home country and across the Middle East and the
world.

Then on March 15, 2012, Bassel Khartabil was arrested in the Mazzeh
district of Damascus, in the midst of the unrest across Syria. We
wouldn't find out for some weeks what had happened to him. His ordeal is
now more widely known. Months spent in a dark cell. A speedy and unjust
military trial. An indefinite sentence. His marriage to Noura Ghazi from
prison. Global recognition and accolades for his creativity and
resistance.

On October 23, 2015, Bassel was taken from his cell at Adra Prison
in Damascus, and has not been heard from since.

This week the FREEBASSEL campaign launched [#freebassel5years] to
promote public acts in support of Bassel Khartabil.

In the spirit of creativity and resistance that we recognize in Bassel
and which he has inspired in us, we are inviting FREESOULS to share
their own stories in a new project, [Creative Resistance: Stories from
Freesouls].

Send yours to [books@freesouls.cc](mailto:books@freesouls.cc).
