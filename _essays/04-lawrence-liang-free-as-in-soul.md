There is a moment in the film Closer when Jude Law, a photographer, is
asked by Julia Roberts how he feels stealing the lives of people. He
replies that he does not steal their lives, he merely borrows them. This
idea of borrowing as it seems to reside in the world of images is an
interesting entry point for us to think about the relationship between
the image, borrowing and the language of intellectual property. Digital
technology has made photography more accessible to people, and we have
seen a proliferation in image-making capacity. At the same time, the
increased restrictions imposed on the still and moving image reveal the
intense anti-image politics of copyright. Thus images come with legal
restrictions, technological barriers and moral injunctions, all of which
act against, rather than in favor of, the image. In a sense the
commodification of image-making through copyright threatens to render it
a commercial activity, one with no soul. Joi Ito's collection FREESOULS
seeks to challenge the anti-image tendency of copyright, and it is
interesting that he uses the metaphor of the soul in relation to
photography, since the history of copyright's relation to the camera has
always been on the contested terrain of the 'soul.' I will take this
opportunity to reflect on the history of photography in copyright law as
it emerged in the twilight of the 19th century and on the changes that
we see at the dawn of the 21st.

A PORTRAIT OF THE CAMERA AS A YOUNG ARTIST

It is well-documented that the philosophical justification of copyright
is premised on the idea of the romantic author, the sole suffering
genius sitting in isolation and producing works of genius. The first
serious challenge to the idea of the romantic author emerged with the
invention of photography. Bernard Edelman states that "the eruption of
the modern techniques of the reproduction of the real - photographic
apparatuses, cameras - surprises the law in the quietude of its
categories."<a name="1"></a><a href="#footnote-1"
class="fn-it"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

Initially the law was not ready for the challenge that would be posed to
it by this new technology. Faced with the question of whether a
photograph could be considered on the same plane as a painting, the
initial response of the courts was in the negative. For French law, the
crucial question was whether or not the mechanical product could be said
to have anything of the soul in it at all. An authored work (it was
argued) is imbued with something of the human soul, but a
machine-produced work is completely soulless. 18. Ibid. Yet, this
soulless craft had at the same time also become an important economic
activity, with thousands in France making a living through photography
and photographic technologies. France itself was exporting photographic
images, and demands were soon made for the protection of these images,
predicating that "the soulless photographer will be set up as an artist
and the filmmaker as a creator since the relations of production will
demand it".<a name="2"></a><a href="#footnote-2"
class="fn-it"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

In the US, there were similar questions being asked of this new
technology in so far as it came as a surprise to copyright law. In
Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony,<a name="3"></a><a
href="#footnote-3" class="fn-it"><sup>[3]</sup></a> the Supreme Court
was faced for the first time with the issue of whether amending the
Copyright Act to include photographs was constitutionally valid. The
pictures in dispute were that of Oscar Wilde taken by Sarony and
reprinted by Burrow-Giles without the permission of the
photographer. The Supreme Court held that the amendment was valid and
within the constitutional powers granted to Congress. However, to arrive
at this conclusion the Court had to argue that photography could be
protected in the same manner as any other work of creation that emerged
from an 'author'. How does the Court make this argument?

The Court observed that:

> "an author in that sense is 'he to whom anything owes its origin;
> originator; maker; one who completes a work of science or literature.'
> So, also, no one would now claim that the word 'writing' in this
> clause of the constitution, though the only word used as to subjects
> in regard to which authors are to be secured, is limited to the actual
> script of the author, and excludes books and all other printed matter.
> By writings in that clause are meant the literary productions of those
> authors; and Congress very properly has declared these to include all
> forms of writing, printing, engravings, etchings, etc. by which the
> ideas in the mind of the author are given visible expression. The only
> reason why photographs were not included in the extended list in the
> act of 1802 is, probably, that they did not exist; photography, as an
> art, was then unknown, and the scientific principle on which it rests,
> and the chemicals and machinery by which it is operated, have all been
> discovered long since that statute was enacted. We entertain no doubt
> that the Constitution is broad enough to cover an act authorizing the
> copyright of photographs, so far as they are representatives of
> original intellectual conceptions of the author."

The first move is therefore to equate the photographer, and what he does
with photographic technology, to the status of an author - a concept
which the law is very familiar with and can grasp without too much
difficulty. But that does not automatically solve the Court's
difficulty, as it is still faced with the question of the role that
technology plays in this production process.

In the words of the Court:

> "But it is said that an engraving, a painting, a print, does embody
> the intellectual conception of its author, in which there is novelty,
> invention, originality, and therefore comes within the purpose of the
> Constitution in securing its exclusive use or sale to its author,
> while a photograph is the mere mechanical reproduction of the physical
> features or outlines of some object, animate or inanimate, and
> involves no originality of thought or any novelty in the intellectual
> operation connected with its visible reproduction in shape of a
> picture. That while the effect of light on the prepared plate may have
> been a discovery in the production of these pictures, and patents
> could properly be obtained for the combination of the chemicals, for
> their application to the paper or other surface, for all the machinery
> by which the light reflected from the object was thrown on the
> prepared plate, and for all the improvements in this machinery, and in
> the materials, the remainder of the process is merely mechanical, with
> no place for novelty, invention, or originality. It is simply the
> manual operation, by the use of these instruments and preparations, of
> transferring to the plate the visible representation of some existing
> object, the accuracy of this representation being its highest merit.
> This may be true in regard to the ordinary production of a photograph,
> and that in such case a copyright is no protection."

The answer is to distinguish between the mere mechanical technology that
the camera seems to be and the transformation of that technology by the
investment of the soul of the author. In this case the court poetically
describes the photograph in dispute in the following way:

> " ...It is a 'useful, new, harmonious, characteristic, and graceful
> picture, and that plaintiff made the same... entirely from his own
> original mental conception, to which he gave visible form by posing
> the said Oscar Wilde in front of the camera, selecting and arranging
> the costume, draperies, and other various accessories in said
> photograph, arranging the subject so as to present graceful outlines,
> arranging and disposing the light and shade, suggesting and evoking
> the desired expression, and from such disposition, arrangement, or
> representation, made entirely by plaintiff, he produced the picture in
> suit.'
>
> "These findings, we think, show this photograph to be an original work
> of art, the product of plaintiff's intellectual invention, of which
> plaintiff is the author."

So, photography graduates from a soulless technology undeserving of the
protections of copyright law, and is elevated to the same status as a
painting or any other great 'work of art,' a status symbolizing the
unique creativity of the author. What then is the crucial legal
innovation that was required for the law to understand this new
technology and translate it within the terms of copyright law?

In order for copyright law to be able to accept the claims of the
photographer as a co-equal author, it becomes important to resurrect the
creative subject who had disappeared into the machine. A soul has to be
found in a mechanical act, the soulless labor of operating a camera. But
this soul or personality cannot flow through the apparatus, and so the
apparatus must be circumventedâˆ’otherwise authorial credit would be void.
Creative genius therefore must navigate its way through the apparatus
and make its mark without actually touching the apparatus. It therefore
must provide a mere imprint of personalityâˆ’and this is never really
found in the work but present everywhere elseâˆ’in choice, technique,
artistic practice, etcetera.

The result of this creative subject's interaction with the mechanical
device is a wholly new object, one which is now protected by copyright
law. It is protectable because the new technology has been given an
"imprint of personality," and is converted into an act marked by the
sign of the author. Thus, the initial surprise felt by the law in its
encounter with technology is now rendered familiar and understandable.
So "new technologies may 'surprise' old categories, but only to be
reformed according to existing conceptions of the world. Science and
engineering may produce technologies that outstrip human capabilities,
but these strange inventions are soon reconceivedâˆ’domesticated and
humanizedâˆ’as they the are put to use."<a name="4"></a><a
href="#footnote-4" class="fn-it"><sup>[4]</sup></a>

However, even after copyright demanded that of the soul of the author be
infused into photography for it to be protectable, subsequent
developments in copyright have shown scant regard for the soul of the
photographer and have focused instead on the exchange value of the
photograph-as-commodity. Joi Ito's photographic contributions will
significantly aid our understanding of the anti-image politics of
copyright, and to enable a greater reflection on the future of the image
as being one in which the image is free as in soul.
