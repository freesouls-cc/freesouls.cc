People act and learn together for a rich mixture of reasons. The current
story that most of us tell ourselves about how humans get things done is
focused on the well-known flavors of self-interest, which make for great
drama−survival, power, wealth, sex, glory. People also do things
together for fun, for the love of a challenge, and because we sometimes
enjoy working together to make something beneficial to everybody. If I
had to reduce the essence of Homo sapiens to five words, "people do
complicated things together" would do. Online social networks can be
powerful amplifiers of collective action precisely because they augment
and extend the power of ever-complexifying human sociality. To be sure,
gossip, conflict, slander, fraud, greed and bigotry are part of human
sociality, and those parts of human behavior can be amplified, too. But
altruism, fun, community and curiosity are also parts of human
sociality−and I propose that the Web is an existence proof that these
capabilities can be amplified, as well. Indeed, our species' social
inventiveness is central to what it is to be human. The parts of the
human brain that evolved most recently, and which are connected to what
we consider to be our "higher" faculties of reason and forethought, are
also essential to social life. The neural information-processing
required for recognizing people, remembering their reputations, learning
the rituals that remove boundaries of mistrust and bind groups together,
from bands to communities to civilizations, may have been enabled by
(and may have driven the rapid evolution of) that uniquely human brain
structure, the neocortex. <a name="1"></a><a href="#footnote-1"
class="fn-it"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

But I didn't start out by thinking about the evolutionary dynamics of
sociality and the amplification of collective action. Like all of the
others in this book, I started out by experiencing the new ways of being
that Internet social media have made possible. And like the other
Freesouls, Joi Ito has played a catalytic, communitarian,
Mephistophelian, Pied-Piper-esque, authority-challenging, fun-loving
role in my experiences of the possibilities of life online.

### Friends and Enthusiasts

To me, direct experience of what I later came to call virtual
communities<a name="2"></a><a href="#footnote-2"
class="fn-it"><sup>[2]</sup></a> preceded theories about the ways people
do things together online. I met Joi Ito in the 1980s as part of what we
called "the Electronic Networking Association," a small group of
enthusiasts who thought that sending black and white text to BBSs with
1200 baud modems was fun. Joi, like Stewart Brand, was and is what Fred
Turner<a name="3"></a><a href="#footnote-3"
class="fn-it"><sup>[3]</sup></a> calls a network entrepreneur, who
occupies what Ronald Burt<a name="4"></a><a href="#footnote-4"
class="fn-it"><sup>[4]</sup></a> would call key structural roles−what
Malcolm Gladwell<a name="5"></a><a href="#footnote-5"
class="fn-it"><sup>[5]</sup></a> called a connector.  Joi was also a
believer in going out and doing things and not just talking about it.

Joi was one of the founders of a multicultural BBS in Tokyo, and in the
early 1990s I had begun to branch out from BBSs and the WELL<a
name="6"></a><a href="#footnote-6" class="fn-it"><sup>[6]</sup></a> to
make connections in many different parts of the world. The fun of
talking, planning, debating and helping each other online came before
the notion that our tiny subculture might grow into a worldwide,
many-to-many, multimedia network of a billion people.  We started to
dream about future cybersocial possibilities only after personally
experiencing something new, moving and authentic in our webs of budding
friendship and collaboration. In recent years, cyberculture studies has
grown into a discipline−more properly, an interdiscipline involving
sociologists, anthropologists, historians, psychologists, economists,
programmers and political scientists. Back when people online argued in
1200 baud text about whether one could properly call what we were doing
a form of community, there was no body of empirical evidence to serve as
a foundation for scientific argument−all theory was anecdotal. By now,
however, there is plenty of data.

One particularly useful affordance of online sociality is that a great
deal of public behavior is recorded and structured in a way that makes
it suitable for systematic study. One effect of the digital Panopticon
is the loss of privacy and the threat of tyrannical social control;
another effect is a rich body of data about online behavior. Every one
of Wikipedia's millions of edits, and all the discussion and talk pages
associated with those edits, is available for inspection−along with
billions of Usenet messages. Patterns are beginning to emerge. We're
beginning to know something about what works and what doesn't work with
people online, and why.

Does knowing something about the way technical architecture influences
behavior mean that we can put that knowledge to use? Now that we are
beginning to learn a little about the specific sociotechnical
affordances of online social networks, is it possible to derive a
normative design? How should designers think about the principles of
beneficial social software? Can inhumane or dehumanizing effects of
digital socializing be mitigated or eliminated by better media design?
In what ways does the design of social media enable or prevent heartfelt
communitas, organized collective action, social capital, cultural and
economic production? I've continued to make a direct experience of my
life online−from lifelong friends like Joi Ito to the other people
around the world I've come to know, because online media made it
possible to connect with people who shared my interests, even if I had
never heard of them before, even if they lived on the other side of the
world. But in parallel with my direct experience of the blogosphere,
vlogosphere, twitterverse and other realms of digital discourse, I've
continued to track new research and theory about what cyberculture might
mean and the ways in which online communication media influence and are
shaped by social forces.

### The Values of Volunteers

One of the first questions that arose from my earliest experiences
online was the question of why people in online communities should spend
so much time answering each other's questions, solving each other's
problems, without financial compensation. I first encountered Yochai
Benkler in pursuit of my curiosity about the reason people would work
together with strangers, without pay, to create something nobody
owns−free and open source software. First in Coase's Penguin,<a
name="7"></a><a href="#footnote-7" class="fn-it"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and
then in The Wealth of Networks,<a name="8"></a><a href="#footnote-8"
class="fn-it"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Benkler contributed to important
theoretical foundations for a new way of thinking about online
activity−"commons based peer production," technically made possible by a
billion PCs and Internet connections−as a new form of organizing
economic production, together with the market and the firm. If Benkler
is right, the new story about how humans get things done includes an
important corollary−if tools like the PC and the Internet make it easy
enough, people are willing to work together for non-market incentives to
create software, encyclopedias and archives of public domain literature.
While the old story<a name="9"></a><a href="#footnote-9"
class="fn-it"><sup>[9]</sup></a> is that people are highly unlikely to
cooperate with strangers to voluntarily create public goods, the new
story seems to be that people will indeed create significant common
value voluntarily, if it is easy enough for anybody to add what they
want, whenever they want to add it ("self election"). There is plenty of
evidence to support the hypothesis that what used to be considered
altruism is now a byproduct of daily life online. So much of what we
take for granted as part of daily life online, from the BIND software
that makes domain names work, to the Apache webserver that powers a
sizable chunk of the world's websites, to the cheap Linux servers that
Google stacks into its global datacloud, was created by volunteers who
gave their creations away to make possible something larger−the Web as
we know it.

To some degree, the explosion of creativity that followed the debut of
the Web in 1993 was made possible by deliberate design decisions on the
part of the Internet's architects−the end-to-end principle, built into
the TCP/IP protocols that make the Internet possible, which deliberately
decentralizes the power to innovate, to build something new and even
more powerful on what already exists. Is it possible to understand
exactly what it is about the web that makes Wikipedia, Linux,
FightAIDS@Home, the Gutenberg Project and Creative Commons possible? And
if so, can this theoretical knowledge be put to practical use? I am
struck by a phrase of Benkler's from his essay in this book: "We must
now turn our attention to building systems that support human
sociality." That sounds right. But how would it be done? It's easy to
say and not as easy to see the ways in which social codes and power
structures mold the design of communication media. We must develop a
participative pedagogy, assisted by digital media and networked publics,
that focuses on catalyzing, inspiring, nourishing, facilitating, and
guiding literacies essential to individual and collective life.

### A Participative Pedagogy

To accomplish this attention-turning, we must develop a participative
pedagogy, assisted by digital media and networked publics, that focuses
on catalyzing, inspiring, nourishing, facilitating, and guiding
literacies essential to individual and collective life in the 21st
century. Literacies are where the human brain, human sociality and
communication technologies meet. We're accustomed to thinking about the
tangible parts of communication media−the devices and networks−but the
less visible social practices and social affordances, from the alphabet
to TCP/IP, are where human social genius can meet the augmenting power
of technological networks. Literacy is the most important method Homo
sapiens has used to introduce systems and tools to other humans, to
train each other to partake of and contribute to culture, and to
humanize the use of instruments that might otherwise enable
commodification, mechanization and dehumanization. By literacy, I mean,
following on Neil Postman and others, the set of skills that enable
individuals to encode and decode knowledge and power via speech,
writing, printing and collective action, and which, when learned,
introduce the individual to a community. Literacy links technology and
sociality. The alphabet did not cause the Roman Empire, but made it
possible. Printing did not cause democracy or science, but literate
populations, enabled by the printing press, devised systems for citizen
governance and collective knowledge creation. The Internet did not cause
open source production, Wikipedia or emergent collective responses to
natural disasters, but it made it possible for people to act together in
new ways, with people they weren't able to organize action with before,
in places and at paces for which collective action had never been
possible. Literacies are the prerequisite for the human agency that used
alphabets, presses and digital networks to create wealth, alleviate
suffering and invent new institutions. If the humans currently alive are
to take advantage of digital technologies to address the most severe
problems that face our species and the biosphere, computers, telephones
and digital networks are not enough. We need new literacies around
participatory media, the dynamics of cooperation and collective action,
the effective deployment of attention and the relatively rational and
critical discourse necessary for a healthy public sphere.

Like Yochai Benkler and Henry Jenkins,<a name="11"></a><a
href="#footnote-11" class="fn-it"><sup>[11]</sup></a> I believe that a
participatory culture in which most of the population see themselves as
creators as well as consumers of culture is far more likely to generate
freedom and wealth for more people than one in which a small portion of
the population produces culture that the majority passively consume. The
technological infrastructure for participatory media has grown rapidly,
piggybacking on Moore's Law, globalization, the telecom bubble and the
innovations of Swiss physicists and computer science
students. Increasingly, access to that infrastructure−the ability to
upload a Macaca video or uncover a threat to democracy−has become
economically accessible. Literacy−access to the codes and communities of
vernacular video, microblogging, social bookmarking, wiki
collaboration−is what is required to use that infrastructure to create a
participatory culture. A population with broadband infrastructure and
ubiquitous computing could be a captive audience for a cultural
monopoly, given enough bad laws and judicial rulings. A population that
knows what to do with the tools at hand stands a better chance of
resisting enclosure. The more people who know how to use participatory
media to learn, inform, persuade, investigate, reveal, advocate and
organize, the more likely the future infosphere will allow, enable and
encourage liberty and participation. Such literacy can only make action
possible, however−it is not in the technology, or even in the knowledge
of how to use it, but in the ways people use knowledge and technology to
create wealth, secure freedom, resist tyranny.
