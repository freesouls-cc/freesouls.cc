This book is made with the wish that words and images be means of
expression, rather than objects of control. Creative expression is a
release of human energy. Copyright is a law, used to protect and forbid.

So we have tried to make this book as free as possible.<br/>
We invite you to read it, share it... and use it.

The photographs in this book were taken over the course of a year, after
the 1st quarter of 2007 and before the 3rd quarter of 2008. As Joi tells
it, these photographs became possible after a breakthrough in
technology. But we believe the cultural movement that Joi has captured
here is a breakthrough of the human spirit.

The essays in this book are meant to offer a synchronic slice of
contemporary free culture theory. In his foreword to the book, [Lawrence
Lessig] has described Joi Ito as a member of a new class of amateurs,
enabled by new thinking as well as bleeding-edge technology. In a
special interview, [Joi Ito] answers questions about photography after
the death of the darkroom, and his own role in the free culture
movement. [Howard Rheingold] kindly shares some of his reminiscences
while enthusing about how to "teach" the future. In his very topical
essay, [Lawrence Liang] cross-examines the moment in legal history when
photography became art.  [Cory Doctorow], very true to form, gets
righteous about the false ownership of knowledge. [Yochai Benkler]
expounds on human systems and finds a little bit of heaven in the
disaster area of modern life. [Isaac Mao] tries to incite a mind
revolution with the his first full treatment of the theory of
Sharism. And [Marko Ahtisaari] contemplates the future of travel and a
life lived at jet speed. We also asked many of the generous people who
appear in this book to give us their thoughts about what 'A freesoul
is...'

This is a work of amateurs.

Please share it!
