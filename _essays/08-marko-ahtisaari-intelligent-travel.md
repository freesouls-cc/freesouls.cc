> "Sometimes one must stop and sit by the roadside, and wait for the soul

For me, and certainly for many many others, Joi Ito is the model of the
intelligent, social traveler. Whenever we think of Joi, we wonder what
interesting city he might be in today, what great people he must be
sharing a meal with, or whose photographic soul he is freeing at this
very moment. But in the end we know we can always follow his digital
traces online, and find the answers.

Tokyo today, San Francisco tomorrow, Amsterdam next week. And now
playing: the first verse of Airport City by Giant Robot, singing a scene
of cosmopolitan jet speed:

> "Career is alright thank you for asking<br/>
>  Short notice no time for packing<br/>
>  Shuttle to the terminal traveling light<br/>
>  Last on the plane timing is right"

Right now−seated as I am in business−lounge suburbia in the airport city
of Heathrow, waiting for the flight home to finally board (not having
quite the right timing à la Giant Robot)−right now seems a fitting time
to reflect on the joy of travel, but also to imagine how much better it
can get. In many ways, I want to celebrate the world that travel brings
to me, as well as how happy I am to be going home.

### High-Velocity Life

Following the twitter jet stream of friends around the world, I wonder
about life lived at such high velocities−velocities that are physical,
mental, emotional−and what effect this must have on one's soul. I wonder
whether our souls aren't getting left behind, and whether we should wait
for them to catch up, rather than catch the next flight. Having myself
lived a life quite like Joi's, off and on, I do worry about how living
the fast life−if not suffering from jet lag−might dampen our senses and
alienate us from everything we hold dear. Every now and again when I
find myself in the company of a well-traveled Helsinki clergyman, he
often turns to me and asks, "So, how is your soul doing?" The question
always makes one pause.

Yet to be completely emotionally and intellectually honest, at the
beginning of my travels, I am not paralyzed with concern about a life
lived at high velocity. I am energized. Joshua Cooper Ramo (whose
portrait features in this collection and who is no stranger to this mode
of living) writes about this kind of life with beautiful optimism:

> "What happens with a high-velocity life is that some of the strictures
> of reality begin to fade away. It is not that the hassles and problems
> of ordinary travel disappear. What is really disappearing is the sense
> of connectedness to anything other than what you can take with you
> when you travel. And those things are your ideas, your dreams, your
> hopes and your senses... You find at a certain speed that you can slip
> without ripples into each of these new pools of experience and come
> out feeling more refreshed than when you went
> in."

I do believe that we all feel concern for our souls, and that the
question asked by my clergyman friend is one that we should ask
ourselves, and each other, every day: "How is your soul doing?" But I
also feel a real enthusiasm for the sentiment that Joshua expresses so
beautifully, and which Joi embodies so perfectly: that we travel, and
live, with the very best of our senses, our ideas, our hopes, our
dreams.

One question that I am trying to answer, both professionally and
personally, is how to manage a new kind of travel−a better experience of
travel that refreshes. A style of travel "without ripples."

The answer to this question may well lie in a new breed of online
informatics that extends the experience of intelligent travel beyond the
small society that you can find in this book. Is it possible that the
golden age of travel is not a thing of the past, but the way of the
future?

### Engineering Serendipity, Promoting Sustainability

A new system of intelligent travel is already being imagined, and built.
But the prospects of developing online, interconnected systems−ones
based on the principle of shared intelligence and joined through trusted
social networks−is not unique to one website or a single start-up. It is
a global movement of world travelers sharing local information with
friends, acquaintances, and everybody else.

We are all accustomed to sharing travel tips, but the future will find a
way to bring this insider knowledge to everyone, whether on a public
wiki or a private network. Intelligent travel can leverage the shared
experience and combined intelligence of everyone living at jet speed, as
well as those who just happen to love the place they call home.

But the greatest social benefit of intelligent travel is what I like to
call "engineered serendipity." The system should help lead us to the
happy accidents that make life so exciting, like meeting up with
long-lost friends in exotic locales. Travel has always been linked to
adventure, but in the future we won't have to leave everything to
chance.

And a system that has more awareness−of people, of places, of processes,
of distances−can also make us more aware of what travel is doing to us,
and especially what it is doing to our planet. There is no excuse for
not building systems that help inform us about our carbon footprint,
whether we are flying from Narita to Helsinki or just living a life
online. A system as I describe it might nudge us, but it won't judge us.
What we do with this information is up to us.

### The Return Home: Throw out the Clocks

In the world of intelligent travel, information will no longer be hard
to find. Information will find us. The only thing that will be hard is
finding the time to use it well. Time is the ultimate scarce resource of
the information age. It is the subject of endless pop−song wish lists
ranging from turnin' it back to makin' it (or dis moment) last forever.
The desire to master time has always been with us, and the conveyor belt
lyrics of today have a deep ancestry. But let us listen again to the
recently deceased Pakistani master singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan:

> "Throw out the clocks,<br/>
>  My lover comes home<br/>
>  Let there be revelry.<br/>
>  My lover comes home,<br/>
>  Let there be revelry."

In this excerpt from a characteristically moving Qawwali, "Mera Pia Ghar
Aaya" ("My Lover Comes Home"), Nusrat interprets time differently when
it is a question of love. (As is often the case in Sufi Qawwali, the
object of love remains ambiguous between the divine and the human.)

Either way, we'd like the clocks thrown out. After a fulfilling and
serendipitous journey, we would like nothing more than for every
homecoming to be a time of celebration. Then we will be ready to stop
and sit for a while, and wait for the soul to catch up.
