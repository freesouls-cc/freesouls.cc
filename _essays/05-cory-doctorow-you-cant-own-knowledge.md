"Intellectual Property" is one of those ideologically loaded terms that
can cause an argument just by being uttered. The term wasn't in
widespread use until the sixties, when it was adopted by the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO),<a name="1"></a><a
href="#footnote-1" class="fn-it"><sup>[1]</sup></a> a trade body that
later attained exalted status as a UN specialized agency.  WIPO's case
for using the term is easy to understand: "people who've had their
property stolen" are a lot more sympathetic in the public imagination
than "industrial entities who've had the contours of their regulatory
monopolies violated," the latter being the more common way of talking
about infringement before the ascendancy of "intellectual property" as a
term of art.

Does it matter what we call it? Property, after all, is a useful,
well-understood concept in law and custom, the kind of thing that a
punter can get his head around without too much thinking.

That's entirely true−and it's exactly why the phrase "intellectual
property" is, at root, a dangerous euphemism that leads us to all sorts
of faulty reasoning about knowledge. Faulty ideas about knowledge are
troublesome at the best of times, but they're deadly to any country
trying to make a transition to a "knowledge economy."

READ IT, OWN IT

Fundamentally, the stuff we call "intellectual property" is just
knowledge and information−ideas, words, tunes, blueprints, identifiers,
secrets, databases. This stuff is similar to property in some ways: it
can be valuable and sometimes you need to invest a lot of money and
labor into its cultivation and development in order to realize that
value.

But it's also dissimilar from property in equally important ways: most
of all, it is not inherently "exclusive." If you trespass on my land, I
can throw you out (exclude you from my home). If you steal my car, I can
take it back (exclude you from my car). But once you know my song, once
you read my book, once you see my movie, it leaves my control. Short of
a round of electroconvulsive therapy, I can't get you to un-know the
sentences you've just read here.

It's this disconnect that makes the "property" in intellectual property
so troublesome. If everyone who came over to my flat physically took a
piece of it away with them, it'd make me bonkers. I'd spend all my time
worrying about who got to cross the threshold, I'd make them sign all
kinds of invasive agreements before they got to use the loo, and so on.
And as anyone who's bought a DVD and been forced to sit through an
insulting cack- handed "You wouldn't steal a car" anti-piracy short film
knows, this is exactly the kind of behavior that property-talk inspires
when it comes to knowledge.

IDENTITY, THEFT

But there's plenty of stuff out there that's valuable even if it's not
property. For example, my daughter was born in February, 2008. She's not
my property. But she's worth quite a lot to me. If you took her from me,
the crime wouldn't be "theft." If you injured her, it wouldn't be
"trespass to chattels." We have an entire vocabulary and set of legal
concepts to deal with the value that a human life embodies.

What's more, even though she's not my property, I still have a legally
recognized interest in my daughter. She's "mine" in some meaningful
sense, but she also falls in the scope of many other entities−the
governments of the UK and Canada, the NHS, Child Protective Services,
even her extended family−they can all lay a claim to some interest in
the disposition, treatment and future of my daughter.

Trying to shoehorn knowledge into the "property" metaphor leaves us
without the flexibility and nuance that a true knowledge rights regime
would have. For example, facts are not copyright-able, so no one can be
said to "own" your address, the number on your license plate or the PIN
for your ATM card. Nevertheless, these are all things that you have a
strong interest in−and that interest can and should be protected by law.

There are plenty of creations and facts that fall outside the scope of
copyright, trademark, patent and the other rights that make up the hydra
of Intellectual Property, from recipes to phone books to "illegal art"
like musical mashups. These works are not property−and shouldn't be
treated as such−but for every one of them, there's an entire ecosystem
of people with a legitimate interest in them.

OWNING (UP TO) HISTORY

I once heard the WIPO representative for the European association of
commercial broadcasters explain that, given all the investment his
members had put into recording the ceremony on the sixtieth anniversary
of the Dieppe Raid, that they should be given the right to own the
ceremony, just as they would own a teleplay or any other "creative
work." I immediately asked why the "owners" should be some rich guys
with cameras−why not the families of the people who died on the beach?
Why not the people who own the beach? Why not the generals who ordered
the raid? When it comes to knowledge, "ownership" just doesn't make
sense−lots of people have an interest in the footage of the Dieppe
commemoration, but to argue that anyone "owns" it is just nonsensical.

Copyright−with all its quirks, exceptions and carve-outs−was, for
centuries, a legal regime that attempted to address the unique
characteristics of knowledge, rather than pretending to be just another
set of rules for the governance of property. The legacy of forty years
of "property talk" is a endless war between intractable positions of
ownership, theft and fair dealing.

If we're going to find a lasting peace in the knowledge wars, it's time
to set property aside, time to start recognizing that
knowledge−valuable, precious, expensive knowledge−isn't owned. Can't be
owned. The state should regulate our relative interests in the ephemeral
realm of thought, but that regulation must be about knowledge, not a
clumsy remake of the property system.

The point is that if you try to own your knowledge, it might end up
owning you.

STEAL THIS STORY, SELL SOME BOOKS

So let me see if I can make this point clear, even to you punters out
there. Joi Ito's book is an existence proof--since everyone is all over
this term of art--that knowledge can't be owned. And maybe your image
shouldn't be, either. So I gave Joi my image. Joi gave me this book. So
I guess I'll have to up the ante.

Maybe this book has a statement to make about the future of publishing.
Maybe. I was once asked to write about what bookselling might be like in
the future. So I'll give you one piece about how I imagined life in a
bookstore from now(ish) to 150 years from now(ish).<a name="2"></a><a
href="#footnote-2" class="fn-it"><sup>[2]</sup></a> My story used to be
my property--until I went and had it published--and it will always be
part of my knowledge.  Now it's part of yours. Now you own it, just as
much as I do.

And don't worry. You aren't scheduled for an electroconvulsive therapy
session any time soon.
