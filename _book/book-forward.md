Joi Ito has been at the center of critical movements to make technology,
and creative freedom, available widely. He loves his profession, and he
does it well. Mornings for him do not begin with the regret of who he
couldn't be.

But his success in these fields has also given him an understanding of
the people in these fields. In the twenty-some years of his work, he has
come to know the people of these industries (both commercial and
non-profit) well. They are his friends (Ito has no enemies). He engages
them as a friend, always concerned and giving, never short or
impatient. He understands them by learning to see them in a certain
way. He engages them with the love of friendship by learning to see them
in the most beautiful, or distinctive way, possible.

Digital technologies have now given us a way to see just how Joi sees
the world. By lowering the cost of access and practice, the technologies
have allowed Ito to become an accomplished amateur.  But 'accomplished'
in this context means that he has learned how to capture the person he
sees. And unlike the professional photographer, who ordinarily has 10
minutes to come to 'know' the person he photographs, Ito has had his
whole professional career. He knows these people, he has come to see
them in their most beautiful, or extraordinary light, and he has
perfected an ability to capture what he sees, and share it with all of
us.

**This book is the product of that extraordinary talent.**
